# nodemcu-ito-transition
Nodemcu/ESP8266/ESP12 with MQTT, IR transmitter diode, 433Mhz RC Transmit and receive module. This is a project, as a present for my long lost fiend.... Why not to turn on an air condition before he comes home...

I have no doubt that most of devices around us will have some kind of IOT functionality so this is just like.. transitional phase and the device which tends to IOTize existing devices which we have.
